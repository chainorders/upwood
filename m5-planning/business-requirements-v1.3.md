# Business Requirement Document - Upwood Forest Tokenization Platform
**Version: 1.3**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the business requirements for the development of Upwood forest tokenization platform. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, scope, key deliverables, technical specification and systems architecture to ensure alignment between stakeholders and the development team.

### 1.2. Project Overview
Upwood's platform aims to facilitate the tokenization of forest assets and carbon credits and facilitate a broader tokenization ecosystem of staking, voting, lending and trading. The project involves developing a comprehensive platform for the issuance of security tokens, utility tokens (ecosystem token & carbon credit tokens), asset reference token and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The platform will enable investors to complete legal compliance processes (KYC/AML onboarding), purchase and manage token portfolios, trade assets, and engage with the Upwood ecosystem and DeFi markets. On the administrative side, the platform will provide functionalities for managing token issuance and overall platform administration.

## 2. Functional Requirements
